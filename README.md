I'll be working with a dataset uploaded to Kaggle that contains datapoints that affect the SalePrice of a particular House (with each row consisting of each house)

In this project, I'll:

1.Prepare the data for machine learning

2.Train a model

3.Measure the accuracy of your model

4.Prepare and make a Kaggle submission.

This Model had an accuracy of 83.4% on the Kaggle Website
